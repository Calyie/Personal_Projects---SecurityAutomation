## Introduction to the DevSecOps E2E Automation Project  
The DevSecOps E2E Automation will provide all the process, code, etc. to get quickly setup Secure Development in their organization. The goal is to provide only what is needed, no fluff, just code and directions to use it. A lot of the tools used will be open source, feel free to replace with tools of choice; the goals should still be the same.  

The Ideal goal is **"detect security issues (by design or application vulnerability) as fast as possible."**

The project will be a full solution similar to the image below provided by OWASP Guideline v2.
